## [Unreleased]

### Added
- Lifecycle hooks (`afterUp`, `beforeDown`) — run migrations, scripts, or exec commands inside containers at environment start/stop
- `devx version` command — prints the binary version set at build time
- Multi-platform release workflow — GitHub Actions builds for Linux, macOS, Windows (amd64 + arm64) on `git tag v*`
- Distribution packaging — Homebrew formula, npm package, WinGet manifests, Chocolatey package, install scripts
- `scripts/install.sh` and `scripts/install.ps1` — one-liner installers
- Integration test scaffolding under `tests/integration/`
- Comprehensive `examples/basic/` with all profile types and stub service source

### Changed
- CI updated to `actions/checkout@v4` and `actions/setup-go@v5` with `go-version-file`
- Build scripts now inject version via `-ldflags -X main.version` and include `linux/arm64` + `windows/arm64` targets
- Repository structure reorganised: `packaging/` consolidates all distribution artefacts, `examples/basic/src/` holds example app stubs

### Fixed
- YAML indentation errors in `internal/config/manifest_test.go`
- `cmd/devx/main_test.go` rewritten to use temp files instead of invalid function-variable monkey-patching
